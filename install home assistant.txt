DEBIAN 12
Pre-installation Steps
Step 1: Becoming Root
Before we start, you must make sure you are logged in as root, Debian may not come with sudo installed, so in order to become root type:
su -
Then enter the root password you configured during installation, Be sure not to forget the dash as it allows the system to run the login scripts for the root user.
However, if you are on a system with sudo installed you can use the command:
sudo su -
Before preceding, confirm you are root by typing:
whoami
You must be root in order to continue
Step 2: Updating your System
Before starting it is a good idea to update your system, to do so enter the three following commands:

apt-get update & apt-get upgrade -y

apt-get upgrade -y
apt-get dist-upgrade -y

Step 3: Install Dependency’s
Install all the required dependency’s with the following command:

sudo apt-get -y install systemd-resolved

apt install \
apparmor \
cifs-utils \
curl \
dbus \
jq \
libglib2.0-bin \
lsb-release \
network-manager \
nfs-common \
systemd-journal-remote \
systemd-resolved \
udisks2 \
wget -y

or
apt-get install \ jq \ wget \ curl \ udisks2 \ libglib2.0-bin \ network-manager \ dbus -y

curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh

(curl -sL “https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kanga-Who/home-assistant/master/supervised-installer.sh” | sudo bash -s)

Step 1: Install The Docker Engine
1. Run the Docker CE installation script
Simply run the Docker CE for Linux installation script:
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh
2. Test your Docker Install (Optional)
To test your docker install run the hello-world script:
docker run hello-world
If Docker is working correctly the following message will be displayed:
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Step 2: Install Home Assistant
Installing Home Assistant is easy simply follow these steps
1. Install the OS Agent
The OS Agent allows the Home Assistant Supervisor to communicate with D-Bus and will soon be required
To Install it simply use the follow commands:
wget https://github.com/home-assistant/os-agent/releases/download/1.6.0/os-agent_1.6.0_linux_x86_64.deb
apt install ./os-agent_1.6.0_linux_x86_64.deb
Of course being sure you replace `os-agent_1.4.0_linux_x86_64.deb` with the latest version which matches your CPU architecture. Available at the GitHub Releases page
2. Run the Home Assistant Install Script
Now that you are root simply run these commands to download and install Home Assistant Supervised:
wget https://github.com/home-assistant/supervised-installer/releases/latest/download/homeassistant-supervised.deb
apt install ./homeassistant-supervised.deb
After it has finished running you should be able to access Home Assistant from:
